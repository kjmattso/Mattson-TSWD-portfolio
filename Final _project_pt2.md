# Final Project Part II

## Storyboarding
I started storyboarding on a piece of paper - I find this the best way to start from scratch. I mentioned in part 1 my desire to take a top-down approach, starting broad and then narrowing my focus to a "Call to Action" by the end. Due to the initial breadth of possibilities with this topic, it's hard to know where to start. As such - I created a (very) rough draft to work off of:

#### 1. Introduce severity and prevalance of children's oral health issues - to get audience invested in topic and realize we need change!
   - Statistics on Illness/Infection
   - Statistics on Fear and Anxiety
   - List of long term consequences of childhood dental issues
     - Teeth Issues
     - Confidence Issues
#### 2. Introduce existing public health measures to show how the Government has decided to invest in this issues - build audience investmenta as well
   - Timeline visualization - make it interactive
   - But express how the problem still exists (COVID?)  
#### 3. Transition to how preventable it is! - Keep the mood happy and eager and temper the sad stats :(
   - Visualization on statistics from ADA and papers about how it is preventable
#### 4. Start call to action!
   - Supporting policy
     - Dental Therapy
     - School Based Care
   - At home care/Regular visits
     - Visualization on how to prevent!
   - Donate and support causes
     - Link to various non-profits
   - Potential link to get it on legislative agenda
