# Final Project Part II

## Initial Narrative Organization
I started storyboarding on a piece of paper - I find this the best way to start from scratch. I mentioned in part 1 my desire to take a top-down approach, starting broad and then narrowing my focus to a "Call to Action" by the end. Due to the initial breadth of possibilities with this topic, it's hard to know where to start. As such - I created a (very) rough draft to work off of:

#### 1. Introduce severity and prevalance of children's oral health issues - to get audience invested in topic and realize we need change!
   - Statistics on Illness/Infection
   - Statistics on Fear and Anxiety
   - List of long term consequences of childhood dental issues
     - Teeth Issues
     - Confidence Issues
#### 2. Introduce existing public health measures to show how the Government has decided to invest in this issues - build audience investmenta as well
   - Timeline visualization - make it interactive
   - But express how the problem still exists (COVID?)  
#### 3. Transition to how preventable it is! - Keep the mood happy and eager and temper the sad stats :(
   - Visualization on statistics from ADA and papers about how it is preventable
#### 4. Start call to action!
   - Supporting policy
     - Dental Therapy
     - School Based Care
   - At home care/Regular visits
     - Visualization on how to prevent!
   - Donate and support causes
     - Link to various non-profits
   - Potential link to get it on legislative agenda

Now that I have some framework to work off of, I can start building visualizations.

## Visualizations.

I decided to start building out my story with the above storybaord straight into Shorthand. See the draft below:




To start making my visualizations I had to pre-clean the data. My very first step was to open the code book that youy have to reference to use the.csv from the National Survey of Children's Health. I first erased any row that did not have anything to do with Dental Health. This erased 891 questions out of 922. This left me with 31 possible questions. Having worked with this data set before, I knew there was likely some redundant data - or some columns were transformations of earlier questions. So, I went through this much closer to identify what data I actually needed and make a .csv that could be useable in Tableau, Canva, or any other software I wanted. I ended up keeping 11 columns of data. But, I still had 54000 rows of data - so a lot to work with. 

Fortunately, I was able to make most of the visualizations from theh [National Survey of Children's Health](https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch)
