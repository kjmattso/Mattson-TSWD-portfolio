# Critique by Design

I elected to redesign a visualization from Howmuch.net that shows which University in each state had the highest amount of new student loans borrowed by students in 2020 and 2021.

The issue of rising student loan debt is obviously salient to myself, as as current student. The title of this graph alone drew me eye, and I immediately looked at the states I had connections to. It was a relief not to see Carnegie Mellon as Pennsylvania's listing! However, even when I knew what I wanted to see, it was hard to parse out complete information from the graph. My eyes were drawn to many places and I was overloaded with information. Looking at this graph for even a moment inspired me to make changes on it, some were obvious and some were not. 

Obviously, I found the information from this graph relevant and important. I knew that I was well trained to read visualziations and I still struggled to read this one. Because of that, I chose to remake this graph. I think any redesign of it will greatly benefit audiences, as I believe the intended one for this is incoming college students, and they deserve to have the information communicated clearly and effectively to help them make decisions. 

To start my initial redesign, I addressed my biggest issues first. My main issues were the use of school logos, utilizing both seperate colors and colors scales, the redundancy of the color scales and dollar amount labels, and changing the format from the graph away from a U.S. map. I felt the use of school logos added unnecessary clutter and introduce opportunity for confusion is if logos are unrecognizable or are mistaken for another institution. I felt this confusion overrode any benefits of building a connection to the visualization with the logos. The use of colors to show both cost and type lead to a palette with almost 10 colors. If I had used color, I would have done so with it varying only across one dimension, but I elected not to use a color scale as I felt the information conveyed was distracting from theh main point of the visualization. This also solved the redundancy of the color scale and dollar amount labels. 

Finally I chose to change the format to a bar graph, sorted in descending order. I felt this better communicated the extreme points of teh graph, adn the disparities across locations adn insitutions felt like one of the most compelling pieces of information of the graph, and resonated with the intended audiences best, prospective students and researchers. Finally, I added a better title that I felt was in simpler language. The first redesign is pictured below:

To get initial critiques, I interviewed two different coworkers about their initial thoughts. Both are mid-twenties and are attending college at this time, and I felt they would find this very interesting. However, there was a lot of confusion I had to account for and adjust in my final visualization. I asked the two of them the same 7 questions:

Following the two interviews, I realized that the graph in it's current form was not communicating it's "story" very well at all. While they agreed that it was not confusing to read the values and obersavtions, it was hard to tell what the actual basis of each measurement was - top instution per state. The graph's current form did nto allows them to grasp that, despite it's other strengths. I decided the best way to improve this was to clear up teh graph axes, and improve the title and add a caption te the title. I elected to make the visualization in tableau to add additional interactive features to the graph. These included hover-boxes that shared the sintitution's name and type, as well as the abbreviated state/territory's full name - in case the abbreviations were not clear. 

The original visualization site did not have the data available. I had to manually input the data into an Excel sheet to import it into Tableau. I did save a but of time by finding a publicly available .xlsx sheet that had all 50 states and abbreviations, and I only had to add the 3 territories. I did have to isolate each institution name, type, and amount from the visualization and also add it to the sheet.
