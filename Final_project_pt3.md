### Final Project Part 3

Following part 2 I realized I needed to hammer down my intended audience better. I thought I had landed on it pretty well in the final presentation, but when asked, I realized my presentation was not wuite applicable. To adjust, I decided my audience was still some parents, but also public health professionals. This was a fine line to walk with my audience and use of language. I had to keep photos accessible, credible, and interesting for all in my audience. But, I did not have enough parent-specific language for them to be my sole audience, and language was too general and simple for medical professionals. Instead, I realized my presentation was solely educational for those with little education on the topic (which is most people).

To make these changes, I kept the policy language much simpler than originally intended. I also excluded some of the educational material, as it was not applicable to a large chunk of my audience. I changed a lot of my language to be very directed at the audience - "It's your responsibility", etc.

At this point I was feelign pretty confident about my story, and decided to dedicate my time making smaller changes. First, I ensured that the narrative flow was consistent. Since I had writted the presentation in pieces, I was worried that it would sound like several distinct parts. This included keeping the focus on the audience with my aforementioned "you" statements. It was not as disjointed as I thought, but there was a lot of value in going back through it to fix missing or ill-fitting parts of the presentation. During this run through I also ensured everything was properly cited. I did need to add captions to my Tableau visualizations and add the data site to the references. All fixed now! I also had to update some bar sizes and HTML dimensions on tableau. My US map was zooming in on the wrong place, and my bar graph bars were far too narrow. 

Finally, based on features I did (or did not) like in other's presentations in class, I made sure there was a clear color story, the use of the same HEX colors, filters, and text sizes and font throughout. This I had significant work to fix. But, I found it was distracting when done poorly in other projects. I also made sure that all of my backgrounds blended in whenever possible (tough to do with tableau sometimes). This made everything feel much more seamless to me. 

Now that those are updated, I am ready to call the project done!
