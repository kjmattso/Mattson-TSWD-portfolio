# Final Project Part 1

This is the first part of the development of my final project for Telling Stories with Data Spring 2024.

### Project Background

I am choosing to make an informative presentation about Children's Dental Health. I know, it seems an off topic, but it's one I care a lot about. Having worked at a free dental clinic, I have seen numerous children suffer from what it, almost an entirely preventable, disease. Also unbeknownst to most is that dental cavities are the most prevalant childhood condition, more so than asthma or diabetes even. I won't go in to specifics here, I am saving that for the final, but there are serious health complications if people don't pay attention. 

More importantly to me, is that not enough people care, yet. I consider this a growing public health emergency, that we can easily stop. Especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

### Project Outline

TLDR: Cavities are the most common childhood condition, with life-long effects, but no one is doing enough about it.

The final project will take a simple approach, of starting broad, and narrowing down as we move through the presentation. I will start with some basic facts, hooking the audience in with the severity of the topic, and showing them they SHOULD care. Much of this will be scientific research and raw data of children's health outcomes. At this point I would also like to incorporate national and international comparisons, showing how disparities in children's outcomes. This part will also have a brief history of what I consider important events in public oral health history. This will have the joint effect of letting audience members get some history, while also showing them that this issue has been persistent and ongoing.

After the introduction. I plan to present some research on how standard care can improve outcomes. This won't be a formal call to action yet, but will support a later one. Resources on proper hygiene and care will be available form outside sources, and I would like to use a series of graphs to visualizations to show the before and after impacts of basic care. This will begin to inform the audience about how easily this could be prevented if we raised public awareness. 

Following this, I plan to elaborate on some policy interventions at play and introduce care remedies that might not be doable at home, but are not impossible resources to utilize. Again, this continues to drive home the point of "we should care, we can make a difference". More visualizations showing before and after outcomes will be included, and maybe heatmaps that show the utilization of national policy measures would be helpful and provide a regional connection to American audiences. ("I'm so happy my state does this" or "Why doesn't my state do this?") Again, we aren't quite at teh formal call to action, but we need this info. for it. 

Here comes the call to action: real policies or at-home actions that people can take . I will hyperlink info. more steps people can take after the presentation, and also another big opportunity: raising awareness.I will rely heavily on good graphics to draw attention, as I know many people don't care as much as they should about this topic, and I want them to remember it.
