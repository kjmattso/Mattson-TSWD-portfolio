# Mattson-portfolio
A public portfolio of my work in Telling Stories with Data at CMU - Spring 2024. 

# About me
My name is Kylee Mattson (she/her) originally from Minnesota. My background is in political science and electoral politics. I have a interest in both electoral policy as well as health policy! I am a second year PPM student interested in using visualizations to communicate complicated policy topics to all audiences quickly. 

In my experience, policy and political action can be easily misconstrued or feel inaccessible to the average citizen, and this couldnt be further from the truth! I am a first-generation college student and hope to use my education to make civic engagement and advocacy more accessible for all, and cut through the jargon of policy to better communicate to all audiences.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to both gain the technical knowledges to execute visualizations as well as the theory necessary to design it well before executing. I hope to work in research and evaluation after graduation and would love to be able to communicate my findings quickly for the "TLDR" reader types.
