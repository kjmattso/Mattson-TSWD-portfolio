# About me
My name is Kylee Mattson (she/her) and I am originally from Minnesota. My background is in political science and electoral politics. I have a interest in both electoral policy as well as health policy! I am a second year Public Policy and Management student interested in using visualizations to communicate complicated policy topics to all audiences quickly. 

In my experience, policy and political action can be easily misconstrued or feel inaccessible to the average citizen, and this couldnt be further from the truth! I am a first-generation college student and hope to use my education to make civic engagement and advocacy more accessible for all, and cut through the jargon of policy to better communicate to all audiences.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to both gain the technical knowledges to execute visualizations as well as the theory necessary to design it well before executing. I hope to work in research and evaluation after graduation and would love to be able to communicate my findings quickly for the "TLDR" reader types.

### Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](Visualizing_gov_debt.md)

This assignment included two recreations of OECD data on government debt. The assignment reflects my increased knowledge on using color, formatting, and text to improve the clarity of visualizations.

### Assignment: [Critique by Design](Critique_by_design.md)
This assignment was a redesign and critiques of an existing data graphic about student loan debt origination. I made the visualization redesign within tableau, and you can see the embeded final image.

### [Final Project Part 1](Final_project_pt1.md)
This is the first part of three of my final project. Here, I state my topic (children's oral health), made a basic storyboard, identified my dataset, and some draft visualizations.

### [Final Project Part 2](Final_project_pt2.md)
This is part two of three of my final project. Here I created a more fleshed out storyboard and wireframes in the Shorthand software. I also conducted user interviews for feedback and included that in my write up. You can see the first draft on this page by following the link.

### [Final Project Part 3](Final_project_pt3.md)
The final part of my Children's Oral Health project. The link can be found on this page to my Shorthand story, as well as a small write up on my final presenatation and work on the project.
